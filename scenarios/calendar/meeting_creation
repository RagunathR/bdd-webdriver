Story: Meeting creation
As an user
I want to use meeting creation features
So that I can find a free slot for all attendees
And I can notice attendees automatically

Scenario: Successful meeting creation using the new event form
Given I log in as user1
And I have access rights on user2's calendar
When I create a meeting "Réunion OBM" with user2 tomorrow between 11:00 and 12:30
Then I should be redirected to my agenda
And I should see an event "Réunion OBM" in my agenda
And I should be informed that the event has been inserted
And user2 should see a waiting event named "Réunion OBM" when he access his calendar
