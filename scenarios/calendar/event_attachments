Story: Attach documents to meetings
As an user
I want to attach documents to meetings
So that I can share them with the meeting's attendees

Scenario: Meeting creator attach a file
Given I log in as user1
When I create a meeting "Réunion OBM" with user3 tomorrow between 11:00 and 12:30, with an attached file "test_file_1.txt"
Then I should be able to download the file "test_file_1.txt" when I consult the "Réunion OBM" event
And user3 should be able to download the file "test_file_1.txt" when he consults the "Réunion OBM" event
And an user with read permissions on user1 calendar shouldn't see the file "test_file_1.txt" when he consults the "Réunion OBM" event

Scenario: Meeting creator authorizes document attachments
Given I log in as user1
When I create a meeting "Réunion OBM" with user3 tomorrow between 11:00 and 12:30, with attachments authorized
Then user3 should be able to attach a file "test_file_2.txt" when he consults the "Réunion OBM" event
